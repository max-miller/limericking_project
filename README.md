# The grand limericking project
This repository contains the workings for every stage of my NLP limericking project. The goal was to create a function that could take in a random news text and produce a limerick about the content of the article.

I was inspired by the, well, inspired twitter account https://twitter.com/Limericking which produces topical news limericks. It also struck me as a sort of a fascinating problem to work on, one that touches on all of the aspects that make working with actual human language so tricky: parsing text, extracting meaning, generating language that both follows rules and appears natural.

I am approaching this project in stages and will continue to update as I work. Roughly, I started out learning by doing, tackling the problems in order of difficulty/complexity. As such, the first part of the project was the simplest. Working with Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library, I parsed text into parts of speech, and for pronunciation and generated simple haikus about the topics of the news articles. My final working book and notes can be found in the topical haiku folder.
