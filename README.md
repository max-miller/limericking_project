# The grand limericking project
This repository contains the workings for every stage of my NLP limericking project. The goal was to create a function that could take in a random news text and produce a limerick about the content of the article.

I was inspired by the, well, inspired twitter account https://twitter.com/Limericking which produces topical news limericks. It also struck me as a sort of a fascinating problem to work on, one that touches on all of the aspects that make working with actual human language so tricky: parsing text, extracting meaning, generating language that both follows rules and appears natural.
